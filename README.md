# Google Vertex AI API Client

## Prerequisites
- [Golang](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- [Gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

Since the Vertex AI API does not allow API Keys,
the API Client will automatically use the credentials
from the environment to create an access token to be used
in the request.

### Usage

Authenticate with user GCP credentials

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```
